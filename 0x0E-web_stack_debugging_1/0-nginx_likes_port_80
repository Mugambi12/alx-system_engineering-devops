#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script is intended to fix the issue with Nginx not listening on port 80.
# It will configure Nginx to listen on port 80 of all active IPv4 IPs.

# Step 1: Check if Nginx is installed
if ! [ -x /usr/sbin/nginx ]; then
    # If Nginx is not installed, install it
    apt-get -y update
    apt-get -y install nginx
fi

# Step 2: Ensure Nginx is running
# Start Nginx if it's not already running
if ! service nginx status >/dev/null; then
    service nginx start
fi

# Step 3: Configure Nginx to listen on port 80
# Nginx's default configuration should be modified
# to listen on port 80 by default.

# We'll create a new configuration file for Nginx
echo "server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }
}" > /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

# Step 4: Restart Nginx to apply the changes
service nginx restart

# Step 5: Check if Nginx is successfully serving on port 80
if [ "$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' 0:80)" -eq 200 ]; then
    echo "Nginx is successfully serving on port 80."
else
    echo "Nginx is not serving on port 80 as expected."
