# 0x0A Configuration Management Project

This project covers various tasks related to Configuration Management, DevOps, SysAdmin, Scripting, and CI/CD. The tasks involve working with Puppet, a popular configuration management tool, to automate various system administration tasks.

## Background Context

During their time at SlideShare, the author worked on an auto-remediation tool called Skynet that monitored, scaled, and fixed Cloud infrastructure. The project involved using a parallel job-execution system called MCollective, which allowed executing commands to one or multiple servers simultaneously. A bug in their code led to a significant incident, demonstrating the importance of proper configuration management tools like Puppet.
