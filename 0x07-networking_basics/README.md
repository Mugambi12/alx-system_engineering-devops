# 0x07. Networking Basics #0

This project is part of the DevOps curriculum and focuses on networking basics. The goal of this project is to provide an understanding of various networking concepts and protocols. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the OSI model, different types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP and UDP protocols, and TCP/UDP ports.

## Resources

Read or watch the following materials to gain knowledge about the topics covered in this project:

- OSI model
- Different types of networks (LAN, WAN, Internet)
- MAC address
- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Localhost
- TCP and UDP protocols
- TCP/UDP ports list
- Ping/ICMP
- Positional parameters

Make use of the `man` command or other available resources to access the documentation for the following commands:

- `netstat`
- `ping`

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the OSI Model, its purpose, and how it is organized.
- Understand the characteristics and usage of LAN, WAN, and the Internet.
- Define and differentiate between MAC and IP addresses.
- Explain the purpose and differences between TCP and UDP protocols.
- Understand the concept of ports and be familiar with common TCP/UDP port numbers.
- Use network tools and protocols to check device connectivity.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your Bash script files must be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder
- All Bash script files must be executable
- Bash scripts must pass `shellcheck` without any errors
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script does

## Project Tasks

### 0. OSI model

Create a Bash script that answers the following questions about the OSI model.

### 1. Types of network

Create a Bash script that answers questions about different types of networks.

### 2. MAC and IP address

## General Instructions

- For multiple-choice questions, provide the corresponding number of the correct answer in your answer file.
- Ensure your scripts are executable using the `chmod` command.
- Your Bash scripts should be checked using `shellcheck` to ensure they pass without any errors.
- Use the provided repository for submitting your answers.
- Avoid plagiarism. Do not copy and paste someone else's work.
