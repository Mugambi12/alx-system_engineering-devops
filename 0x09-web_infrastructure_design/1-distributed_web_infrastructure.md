# Distributed Web Infrastructure Design

In this document, we will explore a distributed web infrastructure design that addresses the need for scalability, redundancy, and availability. We'll describe the design's components, their roles, and identify potential issues.

## Design Overview

The distributed web infrastructure design consists of various interconnected components. Let's delve into each element:

### Load Balancer (HAproxy)

The load balancer, implemented using HAproxy, is a crucial component for distributing incoming traffic across multiple web servers. This enhances the infrastructure's scalability and availability. Key features include:

- **Load Distribution:** HAproxy uses a Round Robin distribution algorithm to distribute incoming requests among the available web servers.
- **Redundancy:** The design includes an Active-Passive setup, where one load balancer is active while the other remains on standby. In the event of the active load balancer failing, the passive one takes over.

### Web Servers (Nginx)

The web servers, powered by Nginx, serve as the entry point for incoming HTTP requests. Their functions include:

- **Request Handling:** Web servers handle incoming HTTP requests from users' browsers.
- **Static Content:** They serve static content like HTML, CSS, and images directly to users.
- **Dynamic Requests:** Web servers forward dynamic requests to the application servers for processing.

### Application Servers

Application servers play a pivotal role in processing dynamic content and executing server-side code. Their responsibilities comprise:

- **Dynamic Content:** Application servers process user requests for dynamic content generation.
- **Database Interaction:** They communicate with the database cluster to retrieve or update data as required.

### Database Cluster (Primary-Replica)

The database cluster is designed with a Primary-Replica setup, enhancing both availability and data integrity. The components are as follows:

- **Primary Node:** Handles write operations, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
- **Replica Nodes:** Multiple replica nodes replicate data from the primary node. They handle read operations, distributing the load and improving read performance.

## Issues with the Infrastructure

While this design offers scalability and redundancy, there are potential issues that should be addressed:

1. **Single Points of Failure (SPOF):** While the load balancer and database cluster have redundancy, other components like web and application servers remain single points of failure. This could impact the overall availability of the infrastructure.

2. **Security Issues:** The design lacks details about security measures. There is no mention of firewalls to protect against unauthorized access. Additionally, HTTPS implementation for secure data transmission should be considered.

3. **Lack of Monitoring:** There's no mention of monitoring tools or strategies for tracking the health, performance, and potential issues of the system. Monitoring is crucial for proactively identifying and addressing problems.

In a real-world scenario, it's important to consider networking setup, security configurations, data synchronization strategies within the database cluster, and the implementation of monitoring tools to ensure the health and performance of the distributed web infrastructure.
