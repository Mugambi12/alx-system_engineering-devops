Explanation of each component with real-world considerations:

1. User's Computer: Represents the end-users accessing the website www.foobar.com. In a real-world scenario, this includes various devices and platforms, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

2. HAproxy Load Balancer (Cluster): A cluster of HAproxy load balancers is added to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers for high availability and scalability. In the real world, the load balancer cluster is configured to use algorithms such as round-robin, least connections, or weighted load balancing to optimize traffic distribution.

3. Server 1 (Web Server): Represents the web server responsible for serving static content and handling SSL termination. In the real world, the web server is configured with caching mechanisms, content compression, and security measures like Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to enhance performance and protect against common web vulnerabilities.

4. Server 2 (Application Server): Handles dynamic content processing, application logic, and generates dynamic responses. In the real world, the application server is optimized to handle high traffic, and various techniques like connection pooling, caching, and load-based scaling are implemented.

5. Server 3 (Primary Database): Acts as the primary read-write database for the application. In the real world, the primary database server is optimized for read and write operations, and data is continuously backed up with a disaster recovery plan in place.

6. Server 4 (Replica Database): Acts as a read-only replica of the primary database, providing data redundancy and backup. In the real world, database replication is implemented to ensure real-time synchronization between the primary and replica databases.

7. Server 5 (Additional Server): An extra server is added to provide additional capacity for scalability and future expansion. In the real world, additional servers are provisioned dynamically based on demand and performance metrics.

Justification for the addition of each new element for scalability:

- HAproxy Load Balancer (Cluster): Clustering multiple load balancers allows for horizontal scaling, distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers, ensuring optimal performance and improved fault tolerance. In the real world, load balancer clusters are essential for handling high traffic and providing redundancy.

- Additional Server: Adding a new server enhances the infrastructure's capacity to handle increased traffic and allows for future expansion. In the real world, adding additional servers to the infrastructure can be automated using tools like Terraform or Kubernetes to respond to changing demands.

Benefits of splitting components into individual servers:

1. Scalability: By separating each component into individual servers, it becomes easier to scale each part independently based on the specific resource requirements. For example, if the database needs more resources, additional database servers can be added without affecting the web or application servers.

2. Isolation: Isolating components on separate servers helps in identifying and mitigating performance bottlenecks and issues related to specific components without affecting the entire infrastructure. In the real world, this isolation allows for targeted optimization and troubleshooting.

3. Redundancy: Separating components provides redundancy, allowing for failover and high availability in case of server failures. In the real world, redundancy is critical to ensure uninterrupted service and data integrity.

Consideration of scalability and future expansion in the design:

- Adding a cluster of load balancers allows for dynamic load distribution, ensuring the infrastructure can handle increased traffic as the website's popularity grows. In the real world, auto-scaling mechanisms can be implemented to adjust the number of load balancer instances based on traffic patterns.

- The addition of an extra server provides the flexibility to expand resources and capacity as the demand increases over time. In the real world, cloud-based infrastructure solutions like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud allow for easy provisioning and scaling of resources.

- By keeping each component on separate servers, the infrastructure is more adaptable to scaling individual parts based on usage patterns and resource needs. In the real world, containerization and microservices architectures are commonly used to achieve this level of flexibility and scalability.
