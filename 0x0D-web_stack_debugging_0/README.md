# 0x0D Web Stack Debugging #0 Project

Welcome to the Web Stack Debugging #0 project! In this project, you will dive into debugging issues related to web stacks. Debugging is a crucial skill for a DevOps engineer, and this project will help you develop your debugging expertise by fixing broken web stacks.

## Background Context

The Web Stack Debugging series is designed to improve your debugging skills. Computers and software don't always behave as expected, and that's where debugging comes in. Being able to debug web stacks is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and this project gives you hands-on experience in solving real-world problems.

For each task, you'll be presented with a broken or buggy web stack. Your goal is to analyze the issue, diagnose the problem, and come up with a solution. You'll then create a Bash script that fixes the problem. This process will help you become more proficient at debugging complex systems.

For this project, we expect you to understand these concepts:
- Network basics
